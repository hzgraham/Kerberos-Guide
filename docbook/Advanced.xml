    <para>
      In the previous section I went through creating a disk that you
      can use as the boot disk for a virtual machine. In that example
      it was expected that you would configure your virtualization
      software to use that disk and then the operating system
      installation would take care of creating the disk label and file
      systems. In this section I'll show you the steps required to do
      that by yourself.

      It is also possible to clone an existing physical hard disk
      using the <command>qemu-img</command> <option>convert</option>
      option. This is possible in part due to the original philosophy
      laid down by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson when they first
      created Unix that everything's treated as a file. The syntax for
      the <option>convert</option> option is below.
    </para>

    <programlisting>
convert [-c] [-f fmt] [-O output_fmt] [-o options] filename [filename2 [...]] output_filename
    </programlisting>

    <para>
      I never fully grasped the "everything's a file" concept until I
      tried (expecting to fail) to use the <option>convert</option>
      option to create a virtual disk image of an actual hard
      drive. This section explains how to do just that.
