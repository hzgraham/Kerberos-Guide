    <title>Convert an Image from RAW to QCOW2</title>

    <para>
      RAW images, though simple to work with, carry the disadvantage of
      increased disk usage on the host OS. One option to have is to
      convert the image into the QCOW2 format which uses zlib
      compression and optionally allows for 128 bit AES encryption.

    <note>
      <para>
	When converted to the RAW format the image has the potential
	to take up much more disk space than before.
