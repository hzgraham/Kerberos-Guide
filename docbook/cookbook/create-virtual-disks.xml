  <title>Creating Simple Images</title>

  <para>
    The simplest operation (next to deleting an image) you can do is
    creating a new virtual disk image. Depending on what type you
    choose there are several options available when creating an
    image. For example, if you want encryption, if you want a format
    that supports compression, or even what existing image to base
    this new disk off of.
  </para>

  <para>
    In this example we will start simple and only show how to create
    basic images in different formats. Each will appear to a virtual
    machine as being 10G in capacity.

  <!-- TODO: make terms like 'RAW' and etc... link to a relevant section where they are defined -->

  <para>
    From the <literal>fmt</literal> attribute above you can see that
    the type of virtual disk crated was RAW, this is the default when
    using <command>qemu-img</command>. You can also see that the disk
    will appear as a 10G drive when used in a virtual machine.
