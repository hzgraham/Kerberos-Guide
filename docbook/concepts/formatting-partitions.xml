  <title>Formatting Partitions</title>


  <para>
    Unlike <systemitem class="resource">/dev/sda</systemitem> we
    can't just create a partition on the first <systemitem
    class="resource">loop0</systemitem> partition by addressing
    it as <systemitem
    class="resource">/dev/loop0</systemitem>. This is because
    the kernel has no device created to represent this. Instead
    we'll have to create another device associated with a
    specific offset in our device/file.
  </para>

  <para>
    Why do we have to specify an offset? How do we know what
    offset to specifically?
  </para>

  <para>
    An "offset" just means how far from the beginning of a
    device something is. We need to know this because we're
    going to create a device mapped to the first partition
    (Linux does this automatically for regular disks during the
    boot process). Partitions don't start on the first block of
    a device because filesystem information is stored there. To
    specify the offset we just need to know what sector the
    partition (<systemitem
    class="resource">loop0p1</systemitem>) starts
    on. <command>fdisk</command> can give us this
    information. (Spoiler: 9 times out of 10 the offset for the
    first partition will be 512 * 63 = 32256).
  </para>

  <para>
    Print the partition table using <command>fdisk</command>
    with the <option>-u</option> option to switch the printing
    format to sectors instead of cylinders for units.
  </para>

  </screen>

  <para>
    <systemitem class="resource">/dev/loop0p1</systemitem> is
    our first partition and from the table above we know that it
    starts on sector 63. Since we have to specify offsets in
    bytes we multiply 63 by 512 (the default block size) to
    obtain an offset of 32256 bytes.
  </para>

/dev/loop1: [0005]:5102 (/dev/loop0), offset 32256]]>
  </screen>

  <para>
    Now that we have <systemitem
    class="resource">/dev/loop1</systemitem> representing
    partition of our virtual disk we can create a filesystem on
    it and finally mount it.

    <para>
      The same procedure applies to any arbitrary partition:
      obtain the starting sector, multiply by block size.
